# Email-Slicing-and-Data-Handling
A school summer holiday homework

Updates ->
1. Added ability to load data from files - txt, csv, json. csv and json are meant for emails splitted beforehand whereas txt for unsplitted emails
2. Added ability to save the temp splitted emails and emails from database to a CSV file - planning to add support for json too
3. Removed Bulk Upload button (I now realize there is a difference between bulk upload and load from file, but im just going to ignore it)

Next ->
1. Apply error handling in the code (it is bad rn tbh)
2. add the search db by username feature
