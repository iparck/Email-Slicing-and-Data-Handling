# Email-Slicing-and-Data-Handling
A school summer holiday homework
Created basic UI and linked some buttons and tables

Next ->
1. Bulk Upload (I now realize, what even is the difference between Load From File and Bulk Upload), need to remove one of em buttons
2. Split the Save to File button to 2 buttons (Save DB data to file), (Save temp email data to file)
